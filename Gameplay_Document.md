**GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW & MECHANICS**

**1. Core Concept**

Siege of Gondor is a strategic Tower Defense game where the player acts as the commander of the Gondorian defenses. The primary objective is to protect the **Main Tower** (Citadel) from being destroyed by the armies of Mordor. The game is won by successfully repelling enemies across **3 distinct levels**:

- **Level 1:** 5 Waves
- **Level 2:** 5 Waves
- **Level 3:** 8 Waves

The game is lost if the Main Tower's health reaches zero before completing all levels.

**2. The Gameplay Loop**

The game operates on a continuous loop of preparation, combat, and progression:

**Phase 1: Strategic Placement (Preparation)**

- **Map Layout:** The game features a fixed path (road) that enemies follow from a spawn point to the Main Tower. Players cannot block this path but must build around it.
- **Building:** Using the initial starting gold, the player places defensive towers on "buildable" terrain (grass).
- **Decision Making:** The player must decide whether to build multiple cheap towers for coverage or save for expensive, high-damage towers.

**Phase 2: Wave Defense (Combat)**

- **Level Progression:** The campaign is split into **3 Levels**.
  - *Level 1 (Waves 1-5):* Introduction to mechanics and basic enemy types.
  - *Level 2 (Waves 1-5):* Increased difficulty and introduction of armored units.
  - *Level 3 (Waves 1-8):* The final siege, featuring the longest duration and toughest boss encounters.
- **Enemy Spawning:** Enemies spawn in groups. As the level and wave number increase, the density (number of enemies) and difficulty (enemy types) increase significantly.
- **Automated Combat:** Towers automatically detect enemies within their specific **Range (Radius)** and fire projectiles.
- **Damage Types:**
  - *Archer Towers* deal consistent damage to single targets.
  - *Melee Towers* deal splash/high damage to enemies that get too close.
  - *Ice Towers* apply a "Slow" debuff, reducing enemy movement speed.

**Phase 3: Economy & Upgrades**

- **Gold System:** There is no passive income. Gold is earned **only** by killing enemies (Bounty System). This rewards efficiency; letting enemies pass does not grant gold.
- **Scaling:** As enemies gain more HP in later waves and levels, basic towers become ineffective.
- **Upgrading:** Players must spend earned gold to upgrade existing towers, significantly boosting their Damage, Range, and Fire Rate.

**3. Player Abilities (Active Skills)**

Unlike traditional tower defense games where the player is a passive observer after building, *Siege of Gondor* requires active participation through special abilities with cooldowns:

- **Crowd Control (Gandalf - 'Q'):** When the screen is overwhelmed, the player can cast this ability to **freeze all enemies** in place for a few seconds. This allows towers to deal "free damage" without the enemies advancing toward the base.
- **Area Denial (Rohirrim - 'W'):** A high-damage cavalry charge that sweeps across the path. This is designed as a "panic button" to clear a wave that has breached the primary defense line.

**4. Enemy Dynamics**

The player must adapt their strategy based on the enemy composition:

- **Vs. Orcs:** Requires fast-firing towers (Archer) to handle the quantity.
- **Vs. Trolls:** Requires high-damage towers (Melee) and slowing effects (Ice) to prevent them from tanking all the damage.
- **Vs. Bosses:** Requires usage of Active Skills to stall the boss while all towers focus fire.
